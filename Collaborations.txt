1. MVP:
- Superclass: Particles
- Subclasses: Electron (move in straight line, constant angle, constant direction)
                    + 
              & Confetti (randomized vector, randomized direction, has a lifespan)
                    + @Override updateStatus (to update lifspan) and move (to change velocity)
- Two other components: Simulate for 1 second, chart particle density in each box region
              sort function (sort regions with highest particle density from highest to lowest)
              queue to save particles position per second to map trajectory

- Independent: Collision
               Run for more than 1 second x
               Graphic for trajectory
               Add Subclass Photon (moves in sine curve, which the real photon does
               not do but we will pretend for this project's sake)
